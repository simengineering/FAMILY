# Transmission: Glowing Text Animation

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/matthew-hopper/pen/mdreLgV](https://codepen.io/matthew-hopper/pen/mdreLgV).

A little glowing text animation.
First, some js to wrap each letter in a span.
Then a keyframe animation, with animation-delay mixin, lights up each letter in succession.
